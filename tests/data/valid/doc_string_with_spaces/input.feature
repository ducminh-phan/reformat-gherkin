Feature: Docstrings with spaces
  Scenario: Removing spaces from docstrings
    Given I have a docstring
      """
        This docstring has spaces after the last word     
      """
    And There is a docstring with populated blank lines in it
      """
        This docstring has an empty line in it
        
        That empty line has spaces on it
      """
    And There is a docstring with unpopulated blank lines in it
      """
        This docstring has an empty line in it

        That empty line has no spaces on it
      """
    And There is a docstring with backticks as delimiters
      ```
        This docstring has backticks as delimiters
        The delimiters should be """ after being formatted
      ```
